# Heun's method

The application calculates solution of a differential equation of order one of the form y' = f(x,y) with an initial condition using Heun's method. In addition, an illustration of the given approximation is generated.

Additional information:
- Sometimes there are more than two values in the point labels (always multiples of 2). This is due to errors related to the precision of the calculations. The results should then be interpreted in order from top to bottom, i.e. as the score labelled with a red square is the third from the top, the score with a blue square, third from the top, is its equivalent.
- The graph can be zoomed in using mouse zoom.

This project was an obligatory task on Differential and Difference Equations course at AGH UST.
